# Indian Railways Ticket Price Prediction

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the ticket prices for Indian Railways based on various factors such as `baseFare`, `reservationCharge`, `superfastCharge`, `serviceTax`, `cateringCharge`, `dynamicFare`, `duration`, and `distance`. The goal is to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of fare predictions for passengers and stakeholders in the Indian Railways system.

## Project Overview
The Indian Railways Ticket Price Prediction project involves the creation of a machine learning model that can predict ticket prices based on various input features. By analyzing the relationships and patterns within the data, the model aims to improve the accuracy of fare predictions, benefiting both passengers and the railway system.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes the following columns:
- **baseFare**: The base fare for the journey.
- **reservationCharge**: The charge for reserving a seat.
- **superfastCharge**: Additional charge for superfast trains.
- **serviceTax**: The tax levied on the ticket.
- **cateringCharge**: Charge for catering services.
- **dynamicFare**: Additional fare based on demand and other dynamic factors.
- **duration**: Duration of the journey.
- **distance**: Distance between the origin and destination.

The dataset is preprocessed to remove any inconsistencies and to ensure that it is suitable for training the machine learning model.

## Modeling Approach
The project involves the following steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
2. **Feature Selection**: Identifying the most relevant features for predicting ticket prices.
3. **Model Selection**: Trying different machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to find the best performing model.
4. **Model Training**: Training the selected model on the preprocessed dataset.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and RÂ².
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tuning the model to improve its performance.

## Installation
